Slides 1:
I will talk to you about observability.
Observability is all about
understading the internal operations
of a system based on external outputs.


Slide 2:
Why should we care about observability?
Observability matters as it increases
the reliability, performance, security,
and velocity of software.

How does observability affect these aspects?
Monitoring these systems helps teams
to identify the root causes of issues which then
allows them to systematically improve
applications and services.

If teams are able to identify the issues
that cause systems to behave strangely or
poorly, optimising these pathways are a good
starting point to improve the service or application.

How does the industry achieve observability?
The 3 main ways are logs, metrics, and traces.

What are logs?
Logs are a set of recorded
events that occur during
the operations of a program.
These usually include the date, time, and
ouput of a process.

When a program crashes or encounters an
error, the log is usually the first
place a devops engineer will check.

What are metrics?
Metrics are a measurement taken usually
with respect to time.

Metrics are put in place throughout
the devops pipeline and specifically
in observability it is used for
detecting anomalies, capacity planning
and providing alerts.

What are traces?
A trace is the recorded journey that
a process takes throughout its lifetime
in an application.

Traces are used for root cause anaylisis
where it can be read through to find
the parent proccess of a program.


Slide 3:
Current industry trends of observability;
Machine learning is increasingly being used
to proccess large amounts of data and make
predications based on this data.

Micro-service architecture is the
current industry trend of splitting
up its' services into smaller systems.
The increase in the amount of smaller
systems increases the need of
observability to minimise losses.

Edge devices are things
such as sensors and edge gateways

Next, Open source tooling is being increasinly
adopted as is reduces the cost of
propreitry software and the ability
to modify that software.

Finally, is cloud computing. As the cost
of moving infrastructure to the cloud
decreases and as the ease of
horizontal-scalability increases with services
such as AWS EC2, cloud computing
will continue to grow requirering more
observaility to help maintain this system

A few industry tools.
Grafana.

Future employment pathways will require
a devops engineer to understand and
employ observability.

Current projections are 70% of
teams by 2026 will be using some
sort of obsevability software and
pipelining.

A job listing screenshot taken
last week explores the skills needed.
One of which is observability.
