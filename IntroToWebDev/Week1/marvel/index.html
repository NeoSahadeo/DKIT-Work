              <strong>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) </strong>is an
              American media franchise and shared fictional universe that is
              centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by
              Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in publications
              by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic
              books, short films, and television series. The shared universe,
              much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was
              established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast,
              and characters. Clark Gregg has appeared the most in the
              franchise, portraying Phil Coulson, a character original to the
              MCU.

              The first film released in the MCU was <em>Iron Man (2008)</em>,
              which began the first phase of films, culminating in
              <em>Marvel's The Avengers (2012)</em>. "Phase Two" began with
              <em>Iron Man 3 (2013)</em>, and concluded with
              <em> Ant-Man (2015) </em>. Marvel is also preparing "Phase Three",
              beginning with the release of
              <em>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</em>. The universe began to
              expand with the release of the first official tie-in comics in
              2010, and saw further expansion with the Marvel One-Shots
              direct-to-video short films in 2011 and the television series
              <em>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> in the 2013-14 television
              season from Marvel Television. Marvel has multiple films and
              television projects in various stages of development.

              The franchise ranks as the highest-grossing film franchise both in
              the United States and worldwide, and has inspired other film
              studios with comic book character film rights to attempt to create
              similar shared universes.
