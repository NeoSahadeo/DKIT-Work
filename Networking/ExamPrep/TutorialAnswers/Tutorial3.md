1. Bandwidth is the theoretical limit of the network
speed.

2.
Broadband are anologue signals sent through a medium
Baseband are digitals signals

Broadband can send to multiple channels.
Baseband only sends to one

Broadband is unidirectional (one-way)
Baseband is bidirectional (two-way)

Broadband is used in radios or telecommunications
Baseband is used in Ethernet

3.
Bit rate is bits per second.
Bit duration is the round-trip time for a bit

1/bit_duration = bit_rate

1/(104*10^-6) = 9615 bits per second

5. The twists each wire pair are used to distribute
the noise evenly, which can then be used to subtract
noise from one wire to the other.

6.
Immune to electromagentic interfence
Stronger / Durable
Longer distance (better atenuation)
Higher Bandwidth

7.
EIA/TIA 568 is a standard for cable management which
is used to create future-proof systems.
