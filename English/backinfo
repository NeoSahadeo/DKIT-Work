Be careful with current news. Avoid public opinions and avoid "hype trains"
News sources write ridiculous titles. "Clickbait"

Well how do I get information?
Well... that's a personal question and depends of what you want to believe.
You have to play the judge.

Get context.
Look at both sides of the story, if there is only one, never assume the other sides resolve.
Google the pros and cons / for and against.
