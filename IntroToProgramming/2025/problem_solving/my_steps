Steps:

1. Think of function name = find_high

2. Add parameters to the function as it should take in a list

3. Think about going through each element comparing each value with the previous
   to see which is highest

4. Think about a way to implement that
4.1. For-loops work well with this, loop through using that. Storing the highest
		 variable in it's own variable called "highest"
4.2. Use a if-statement to compare it

5. Return the "highest" variable

PSEUDO:

FUNCTION find_high(LIST_Of_NUMBERS) DO
	highest = 0
	FOR X IN LIST_Of_NUMBERS THEN
		IF X > highest THEN
			highest = X
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
	RETURN highest
END find_high

6. Refine
6.1 If the number is negative the function does not work
6.2 Change highest to start from the first element in the list rather than 0

7.

PSEUDO:

FUNCTION find_high(LIST_Of_NUMBERS) DO
	highest = LIST_Of_NUMBERS[0]
	FOR X IN LIST_Of_NUMBERS THEN
		IF X > highest THEN
			highest = X
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
	RETURN highest
END find_high
