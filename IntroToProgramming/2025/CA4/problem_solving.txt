____AVERAGE____
Where are the grades coming from?
  Answer: User input
How do you take in a grades from that source?
  Answer: input("Enter grades: ")
How do you split up grades?
  Answer: call the .split() method on the string
How are you going to store it?
  Answer: Store it in a list variable

What does the function do?
  Answer: Sum all the values and return the average
How are you going to do this?
  Answer: Loop through all of the elements adding it to a variable
          tally then dividing that by the amount of items.
What type of loop?
  Answer: A for loop
How are you going to add up the values?
  Answer: Using the Python += binary operator
How will you get the amount of items?
  Answer: Use a seperate tally counter

Pseudo-Code
Part-1:
create a function called 'avg'
this function takes in a parameter
create two tally variables, the first called
'length' and the second called 'total'
then create a for loop (complex) that will iterate through
the list in the parameter
after the for loop at a divide operator to divide both
tallys and print the result

Part-2:
take in user input as a single line
split these into seperate "words"
add these "words" to a list variable
pass the variable into the function and call the function

  Answer: input("Enter grades: ")
How do you split up grades?
  Answer: call the .split() method on the string
How are you going to store it?
  Answer: Store it in a list variable

What does the function do?
  Answer: Check which value in the list is the largest
How are you going to do this?
  Answer: Loop through all of the elements in the list comparing
          values to the currently stored highest value?
What type of loop?
  Answer: A for loop
What is the current highest value variable?
  Answer: This is the value where the highest number in the list is stored
How are you comparing the variables?
  Answer: I will use the less than binary operater
How will you pass the list to the function?
  Answer: Passed as a parameter
How will you display the highest grade to the user?
  Answer: A print statement


Pseudo code
part 1:
^^^^^^^
create a function that takes in a parameter
create a variable in the function that stores the highest grade
set this value to negative 1
loop through the grades
if there grade value is greater than the one stored I replace it
finally I return the value or print the value

part 2:
^^^^^^^
take in user input as a single line
split these into seperate "words"
add these "words" to a list variable
pass the variable into the function and call the function

  Answer: Loop through all of the elements in the list comparing

What type of loop?
  Answer: A for loop
What is the current lowest value variable?
  Answer: This is the value where the lowest number in the list is stored
How are you comparing the variables?
  Answer: I will use the greater than binary operater
How will you pass the list to the function?
  Answer: Passed as a parameter
How will you display the lowest grade to the user?
  Answer: A print statement


Pseudo code
part 1:
^^^^^^^
create a function that takes in a parameter
create a variable in the function that stores the lowest grade
set this value to 101
loop through the grades
if there grade value is greater than the one stored I replace it
finally I return the value or print the value

Where are the grades coming from?
  Answer: User input

  Answer: input("Enter grades: ")
How do you split up grades?
  Answer: call the .split() method on the string
How are you going to store it?
  Answer: Store it in a list variable

What will the function be called?
	Answer: most
What will the function do?
	Answer: It will print the value that occures the most
How does it find the value that occurs the most?
	Answer: I will have a tally counter list that stores how
					many times each value occurs than prints the highest
How will you add values to this list?
	Answer: Using the .append method
How will you get these values?
	Answer: I will have 2 loops. The second nested inside the
					first. This way I have a value to compare to everyother
					value in the list.
What loop?
	Answer: I will use 2 complex for loops
How will you find the highest value?
	Answer: I will iterate over the list and compare each value with
					the current highest value.
What is the current highest value?
	Answer: This is a variable I will create outside the loop used to
					store the value. Its outside the loop so it will not be
					reset when the loop restarts.
How will this highest value be used?
	Answer: I will iterate over the list of tallys and keep track of the
					index position. When I reach the value that is equal to highest
					I break out of the loop and print the result of index at the grades
					list position.

Pseudo code
part 1:
^^^^^^^
create a function that takes in a parameter
add a tally_counter list variable and set it equal to an empty list
create my first for loop to iterate over grades
inside the for loop have a counter variable equal to 0
have another for loop nested in the one above to iterate over grades again
inside the nested loop I will have an if statement that compares the current-
-nested value with the value in the loop above. If true add 1 to the counter

create a highest variable set to 0
create a new for loop to iterate over the tally
have an if statement that compares the current element with the value stored-
-in highest. If true replace the value of highest with the current element

create an index variable set to 0
create a new for loop to iterate over the tally
have an if statement that compares the current element with the highest variable.
If true print the result of that index position in the grades list and break

part 2:
^^^^^^^
take in user input as a single line
split these into seperate "words"
add these "words" to a list variable
pass the variable into the function and call the function
